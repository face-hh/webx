## Using other browsers

Since Web X is an open-source network, there are different browsers available, like the following:

| Browser | Where to get it it | Maintainer | Compatible |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Bussin Napture | Go to the [releases tab of the official Web X repository](https://github.com/face-hh/webx/releases/latest). | :heavy\_check\_mark: **Official Web X service** | Windows+, Linux+++ |
| Bussinga | Go to the [Bussinga repository](https://github.com/webx-plus/bussinga/releases/latest). | [WebX Plus organisation](https://github.com/WebX-Plus) | Windows++, Linux+++ |

**Something is wrong with this table? As 3rd party browsers get updated, this table can get outdated over time.** [**Make a PR to help keep it up to date.**](https://github.com/face-hh/webx/tree/master/docs) **Thanks in advance!**

## Using other DNS

Napture and other browsers also give you the ability to choose a different DNS. In Napture, you can change this by clicking the `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `S` keybind to open settings and change the DNS to the URL of the DNS server you'd like to use. A good example of a different WebX DNS is the [WebX Plus DNS](https://dns-one.webxplus.org/).
